Dynamic Product Filter with Dropdown using JavaScript DOM Manipulation
I want to walk you through a simple piece of our website code—it's how we filter the product 
list on our front page. It’s a great example of how our three main tools, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
work together.

HTML:
<body>: This is where all the visible content goes.
<div class="container">: This is a main box that holds everything, giving the page a neat, 
contained look. The container class is used by CSS to style it.
<h2>Product List</h2>: A simple heading for the page.
<label for="category">: This is a text label associated with the dropdown menu, so when a 
user clicks the text, it focuses on the correct input.
<select id="category">: This is the dropdown menu. The id="category" is what the JavaScript 
uses to find this specific element.
<option value="all">: Each <option> is an item in the dropdown list. The value attribute is 
important because it's what the JavaScript code reads to know which category the user selected.
<div id="product-list">: This is a container for all the product items.
<div class="product" data-category="clothing">T-Shirt</div>: Each of these <div> elements 
represents a product.
The class="product" is used for basic styling.
The data-category attribute is a custom attribute that stores the product's category 
(clothing, electronics, or books). This is the key piece of information that JavaScript uses to 
filter the list.

CSS:
body { ... }: Sets the basic font for the whole page.
.container { ... }: Styles the main box with a border, padding, a fixed width, and centers 
it on the page.
h2 { ... }: Adds a little space below the heading.
select { ... }: Styles the dropdown menu with padding and a margin.
.product { ... }: Styles each individual product box, giving it a light border, padding, and
rounded corners to make it look clean.

JavaScript:
const categorySelect = document.getElementById("category");: This line finds the dropdown 
menu using its id and stores it in a variable called categorySelect.
const products = document.querySelectorAll(".product");: This line finds all the elements with 
the product class (all the products) and stores them in a list called products.
categorySelect.addEventListener("change", function () { ... });: This is the core of the 
interactivity. It "listens" for an event on the dropdown menu. Whenever the user changes the 
selected option (change), the function inside the curly braces {} runs.
const selectedCategory = this.value;: Inside the function, this line gets the value of the new 
selected option (e.g., "clothing," "electronics," or "all").
products.forEach((product) => { ... });: This loops through every single product in the products 
list.
if (selectedCategory === "all" || product.getAttribute("data-category") === selectedCategory): This 
is the filtering logic. For each product, it checks if:
The selected category is "all", OR...
The product's data-category value matches the selected category.
product.style.display = "block";: If the if condition is true, this line makes the product 
visible on the page.
product.style.display = "none";: If the if condition is false, this line hides the product 
from view.
