LIVE CHARACTER COUNTER FOR TEXTAREA

Short description- I created a live character counter where users can type in a textarea and instantly see the number of 
characters theyâ€™ve entered. I styled it inside a simple container with a heading, and the count updates
in real-time as the user types.

HTML: 
The HTML is the skeleton of the page. It sets up all the elements and content you see.
<body>: This holds all the visible content.
<div class="counter-container">: A box to hold our tool.
<h2>Live Character Counter</h2>: The main heading.
<textarea placeholder="Start typing..."></textarea>: The text box where you type.
<div class="count">Characters : 0</div>: The line that shows the character count.

CSS: THE STYLE
The CSS is the skin and clothing of the page. It makes everything look good and is located in the <style> 
tags in the <head> section.
body: Styles the entire page by setting the font and adding a margin to create space.
.counter-container: Gives our box a border, padding, and a max width so it doesn't stretch too wide.
textarea: Styles the text box itself, giving it a set height, a clean font, and padding so your text isn't right 
against the edges.
.count: Makes the character count text bold and adds some space above it.

JAVASCRIPT: 
The JavaScript is the brain of the page. It makes the counter interactive and is in the <script> tags at the bottom.
Finding the elements: The code first finds the text box and the count display on the page.
Listening for input: It then adds an event listener to the text box. This listener waits for you to type or delete a character.
Updating the count: Every time you type, it gets the text from the box, removes any extra spaces at the beginning or end with
.trim(), and then counts the characters with .length.
Displaying the new count: Finally, it updates the text of the counter display with the new number. This happens
 instantly, giving you a live count as you type.
